# Install

`plusdeck` is a Python package, and therefore can be installed [from PyPi](https://pypi.org/project/plusdeck/), for instance with `pip`:

```sh
pip install plusdeck
```

In addition, I have a Fedora package on COPR, which can be installed like so:

```sh
sudo dnf copr enable jfhbrook/joshiverse
sudo dnf install python-plusdeck
```
